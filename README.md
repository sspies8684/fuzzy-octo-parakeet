# FocusFlow — Simple Web App

FocusFlow is a minimalist browser-based task planner designed to help you capture quick todos, mark them complete, and stay focused without needing a backend.

## Getting Started
- Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
- Add tasks using the input field, toggle their completion status, or delete them when you're done.
- Use the filter buttons to switch between all tasks, only active items, or the list of completed wins.

## How It Works
- Tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so your list persists between visits on the same device.
- All styling (`styles.css`) and behaviour (`script.js`) are written in vanilla CSS and JavaScript for easy customization.

## Customization Ideas
- Tweak the colors or layout in `styles.css` to match your brand.
- Extend `script.js` with due dates, reminders, or data export if you need more advanced planning tools.
